# Employee Analytics Using SQL

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze employee data to understand department-wise employee distribution and salary patterns.

## Dataset
The project uses two tables:
- employees: employee details such as name, department, and salary
- departments: department information

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries)

## Analysis Performed
- Joined employee and department data using dept_id
- Calculated employee count per department
- Analyzed average salary per department
- Identified departments with more than one employee
- Found employees earning more than their department’s average salary using a correlated subquery

## Key Insights
- IT and HR departments have higher employee counts compared to Finance
- Salary distribution varies across departments
- Certain employees earn significantly more than their department average

## Business Use Case
This analysis helps management understand workforce distribution and salary trends for better decision-making.
